									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>Hi! My name is Troy and I am a computer engineering student<br />
									entering my fourth year at the University of California, Santa Barbara.<br />
									Please enjoy this picture of me (on the left) at big bear.</p>

									<button type="button" class="collapsible">Major</button>
									<div class="content">
									<p>
										My journey in college wasn't entirely a straight line. Up until the end of my
										sophomore year, I was actually enrolled as an electrical engineering student.
										It's safe to say that during those first 2 years, I wasn't able to find something
										that I was truly passionate about. However, I knew that I still wanted to create
										things that I could witness for myself. I found myself more and more drawn to the
										software side of things as I continued to build projects such as the "Hoverquad".
										Projects like the "Gomoku AI" helped to cement my bias towards programming, as it
										showed me the potential of coding. The concept of typing some seemingly arbitrary
										letters and numbers to produce a working product was unusually gratifying. Of
										course I was still interested in the hardware side, the "Wii-nunchuk interfacing"
										part of the "Pacman" project being an example of that. And so, I
										believe I made the right decision in being able to find balance between the two
										in the single major of computer engineering.

									<button type="button" class="collapsible">Fraternity</button>
									<div class="content">
									<p>
										During my junior year, I became a part of a multicultural fraternity by the name
										of Zeta Phi Rho. Shortly after joining, I became the fundraising/philanthropy chair
										and have continued to hold the position to this current day. As an organization,
										we were able to hold numerous events including but no limited to: COVID-19 Instagram
										Fundraiser, Stussy Brand Clothing Sale, Old Town Goleta Clean-up, Adopt-a-Block volunteer,
										Hana Kitchen Fundraiser, etc. We have partnered with both large and Santa Barbara local
										organizations to fundraise money for fraternity activies and assist in charitable
										causes. My responsibilities were to facilitate communication with the organizations
										to ensure basic details such as date, location, number of participants, and hours
										earned. Being in a fraternity and holding this position has taught me valuable social
										and business skills that will undoubtedly be needed again in my future as an engineer.

								<h2 style="text-align: center">Game Development</h2>
									<button type="button" class="collapsible">How It Started</button>
									<div class="content">
									<p>
										In the current summer of 2020, I have found my passion in game development. Using
										the Godot game engine, I have been completely immersed in programming and creating
										games. The thought of making games was always an interesting one, but whether it
										be for lack of time or for fear of complexity, I never gave it a chance. It would
										be wrong to deny the fact that the quarantine played a part in my decision. However,
										I would attribute most of my influence to game developers who made content online
										on youtube. Watching the process of creating games, playing games, and distributing
										games showed me how empowering it was to be able to manifest concepts. Even after
										my first game "Astro", which was basic and beginner-friendly, I felt ecstatic at
										the fact that it was on the internet and people could play it. While it's not
										completely related to engineering, it gives the same sense of reward in the fact
										that your creations aren't just theories, but rather they are products to be used
										in the real world.

									<button type="button" class="collapsible">Why I Like Godot</button>
									<div class="content">
									<p>
										This post is not sponsored by Godot haha. Godot is a FREE open-source engine that has an
										extremely small downloadable executable. Many people compare Godot with Python and
										I would have to agree. The computer logic is funnily enough, very "logical" and easy to
										understand. After about one month of using the engine to make "Astro," I feel like
										I can already call myself an intermediate user. In fact, I check up on the Godot
										discord server quite often to provide assistance to beginners who have questions,
										which I guess could be my way of giving back to those who helped me when I was
										starting out. Many things about the process are streamlined and so there's very
										few instances where I feel as if I'm coding in a "hacky" or inefficient manner. Overall,
										I have to give a lot of credit to the moderators of the engine. Had I started with
										an unpolished product, I couldn't 100% say that I would have gotten into game
										development as much as I have now.

								<h2 style="text-align: center">Hobbies</h2>
									<button type="button" class="collapsible">Sports</button>
									<div class="content">
									<p>
										All my life I've played sports and to list them in longevity, I've played
										baseball, soccer, and basketball which involved my most recent committment to
										the high school team for four years. Sports have definitely played a huge part in
										sharpening my social skills both in casual and business settings. The concept of
										teamwork is not one that is foreign to me. I've rarely felt awkward or misplaced
										in a social setting and I'm unafraid to meet new people. I think people really
										under value how much being in a "team" with a "coach" changes how you perceive
										others who, for example, are your group members in a project. It also helps
										you realize why your own contribution is so important and should not be
										neglected. While listed as a hobby, what's learned from it feels almost as
										essential as what I've learned in school as an engineering student.
									</p>
									</div>
									<button type="button" class="collapsible">Video Games</button>
									<div class="content">
									<p>
										I think the "Game Development" section made it pretty apparent that I enjoy video
										games. To name a few of my favorite titles, I enjoyed the Super Mario Bros.
										series, the Super Smash Bros. series, Pokemon, League of Legends, NBA 2K,
										Call of Duty, Halo, etc... So I've played a lot of games and I've owned all types
										of consoles including the gameboy, gamecube, DS, Wii, XBOX 360 and XBOX One.
										Ironically, I don't really play games anymore because I'm usually spending all
										my time trying to make them. It's really interesting to see how something as
										trivial as playing video games has made an impact on me now. On the other hand,
										I'm not so surprised considering there's titles such as Minecraft and Cities:Skyline,
										which in my opinion are games that promote creativity and engineering in the best
										way possible. While for the longest time people have looked at games as wastes of
										time, I've never been on to agree. It's so easy to connect with someone over a
										common game and provides a platform for communication just like phones and
										laptops do. Most importantly, it promotes a	sense of wanting to finish a goal,
										whether that be completing a mission or beating your best score. And if I've
										learned anything from my life in general, it's that "finishing what you started"
										is 90% of the work.
									</p>
									</div>
									<button type="button" class="collapsible">Editing</button>
									<div class="content">
									<p>
										It's the norm to differentiate and separate the subjects of STEM and art. Despite
										being "STEM-oriented" in both preference and status, I've always been interested
										in art and have even made small steps such as winning a Jr. High School art 
										competition. Over the years, I became interested in video editing with an emphasis
										on producing exaggerated transitions and effects in a "fun" style. It's never been
										something that I've tried to pursue professionally, as my main reason for taking
										up such a hobby is mostly accredited to enjoying myself. When I go on trips with
										friends, it's fun to film and create hilarious montages that we can look back on
										in the future. There's something gratifying about the thought that people are
										able to view your work. Much like engineering projects, video projects are physical
										conceptions that people can access in real life. It's something that
										people can craft opinions on without being an expert in the field and enjoy
										without the complications of how things work behind-the-scenes.
